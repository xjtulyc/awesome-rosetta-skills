## When to Use This Skill

Use this Skill whenever you need to:

- Draft or refine a NIH Specific Aims page following the standard one-page format
- Structure an NSF Project Description with explicit intellectual merit and broader impacts
- Outline ERC Starting Grant B1 (extended synopsis) and B2 (scientific proposal) sections
- Generate a personnel budget justification table with fringe, indirect, and total costs
- Format an NIH Biosketch (personal statement, positions, contributions to science)
- Write a 250-word structured abstract with labeled sections for any funding agency
- Format a BibTeX reference list using pybtex for grant submissions

| Task | When to apply |
|---|---|
| Specific Aims page | NIH R01, R21, K-series, SBIR/STTR submissions |
| NSF Project Description | NSF CAREER, standard grants, RAPID, EAGER |
| ERC B1/B2 narrative | ERC StG, CoG, AdG applications |
| Budget justification | Any sponsored research with modular or detailed budget |
| Biosketch | NIH applications; NSF equivalent (Facilities & Other Resources) |
| Structured abstract | Journal submission cover letters, conference abstracts |

## Background & Key Concepts

### NIH Specific Aims Page

The Specific Aims page is the single most important page in an NIH application.
Reviewers read it first and it determines whether the full application receives
detailed review. The canonical one-page structure is:

1. **Opening paragraph** — Establishes the research problem, knowledge gap, and
   why the problem matters (~100 words).
2. **Long-term goal** — The overarching scientific objective beyond this grant.
3. **Objective** — What this specific project will accomplish.
4. **Central hypothesis** — A testable, falsifiable statement derived from
   preliminary data.
5. **Specific Aims list** — Typically 2–4 aims, each with a brief rationale and
   expected outcome.
6. **Innovation** — What is new about the approach or the scientific question.
7. **Impact** — Expected contribution to the field and public health relevance.

### NSF Project Description

NSF requires explicit separation of **intellectual merit** (advancing knowledge
within a field) and **broader impacts** (benefits to society). Page limits vary
by program (typically 15 pages for standard grants, 20 for CAREER). Word count
guidance:

| Section | Typical length |
|---|---|
| Introduction & significance | 1–2 pages |
| Preliminary results | 2–3 pages |
| Research plan (each aim) | 2–3 pages per aim |
| Intellectual merit summary | 0.5–1 page |
| Broader impacts | 1–2 pages |
| References cited | Does not count toward page limit |

### ERC Starting Grant B1/B2 Structure

| Section | Description | Page limit |
|---|---|---|
| B1 — Extended synopsis | Short self-contained overview of the project | 5 pages |
| B2 — Scientific proposal | Full research plan: state of the art, methodology, resources | 15 pages |

ERC reviewers assess **scientific excellence** (novelty, ambition, feasibility)
and **principal investigator quality** (track record, independence).

### Budget Categories

A typical NIH R01 modular budget ($250 K/year direct costs) or detailed budget
includes:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Personnel | PI, co-I, postdocs, graduate students, technicians |
| Fringe benefits | As percentage of salary (typically 25–40 %) |
| Equipment | Items ≥ $5 000 with useful life ≥ 1 year |
| Travel | Domestic + international conferences |
| Materials & supplies | Lab consumables, software licenses |
| Other direct costs | Publication fees, patient costs, subcontract |
| Indirect (F&A) | Negotiated rate × modified total direct costs |

### Structured Abstract (250 words)

All NIH applications require a structured abstract with labeled sections:
Background, Objective, Methods, Expected Results, and Significance. The total
must not exceed 250 words.

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a dedicated virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install "jinja2>=3.0" "pybtex>=0.24" "pandas>=1.5" "python-dotenv>=1.0"

# Verify installation
python -c "import jinja2, pybtex, pandas; print('Setup OK')"
```

For AI-assisted draft generation, set your API key:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="<paste-your-key>"
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<paste-your-key>"
python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'NOT SET'))"
```

## Core Workflow

### Step 1 — Render NIH Specific Aims Page with Jinja2

Define your grant content as a Python dictionary and render a structured
Specific Aims page using a Jinja2 template.

```python
import os
from jinja2 import Environment, BaseLoader
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

SPECIFIC_AIMS_TEMPLATE = """
SPECIFIC AIMS

{{ background }}

Long-term goal: {{ long_term_goal }}

Objective: {{ objective }}

Central hypothesis: {{ central_hypothesis }}

Rationale: {{ rationale }}

SPECIFIC AIMS:

## Advanced Usage

### NIH Biosketch Formatting

The NIH Biosketch (Form PHS 2590 / SciENcv format) contains four sections:

1. **Personal Statement** — 4 sentences maximum. State why you are well-suited
   for this project. Reference up to 4 publications.
2. **Positions, Scientific Appointments, and Honors** — Reverse-chronological
   list with institution, role, and dates.
3. **Contributions to Science** — Up to 5 paragraphs, each with a brief
   narrative and up to 4 publications. Describe the historical context, your
   contribution, and significance.
4. **Additional Information** — Research support (current and pending).

```python
BIOSKETCH_TEMPLATE = """
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

NAME: {{ name }}
eRA COMMONS USER NAME: {{ era_commons }}
POSITION TITLE: {{ position_title }}
EDUCATION/TRAINING:
{% for edu in education %}
  {{ edu.institution }} | {{ edu.degree }} | {{ edu.field }} | {{ edu.year }}
{% endfor %}

A. Personal Statement
{{ personal_statement }}
Key publications:
{% for pub in personal_pubs %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ pub }}
{% endfor %}

B. Positions, Scientific Appointments, and Honors
{% for pos in positions %}

{% endfor %}

C. Contributions to Science
{% for contrib in contributions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ contrib.narrative }}
   Publications:
{% for pub in contrib.publications %}
   {{ loop.index }}. {{ pub }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
""".strip()


def render_biosketch(data: dict) -> str:
    """Render NIH Biosketch from structured dictionary using Jinja2."""
    from jinja2 import Environment, BaseLoader
    env = Environment(loader=BaseLoader())
    template = env.from_string(BIOSKETCH_TEMPLATE)
    return template.render(**data)
```

### ERC Starting Grant B1 / B2 Outline

ERC proposals require explicit evidence of **scientific excellence** and
**PI independence**. Structure B1 (5 pages) as follows:

| Subsection | Content |
|---|---|
| B1.1 Overview | Project title, keywords, short abstract (10 lines) |
| B1.2 State of the art | Current knowledge and open question |
| B1.3 Objectives | 3–5 numbered objectives aligned with work packages |
| B1.4 Methodology | Key experimental/computational approaches |
| B1.5 Originality | How the proposal goes beyond the state of the art |
| B1.6 Resources | Team composition, key infrastructure |

For B2 (15 pages), expand each subsection and add:
- Work package (WP) table with lead, duration, deliverables, milestones
- Risk assessment table (risk, probability, mitigation)
- Timeline Gantt chart

### NSF Broader Impacts Template

NSF reviewers score broader impacts independently of intellectual merit. Include:

- **STEM workforce development** — graduate/undergraduate mentoring plan
- **Broadening participation** — recruitment strategy for underrepresented groups
- **K-12 outreach** — partnerships with local schools or science museums
- **Open science** — data sharing, software release, preprint posting
- **Dissemination** — target journals, conferences, policy briefs

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Jinja2 `UndefinedError` | Missing key in content dictionary | Add all required keys; use `default('')` filter in template |
| Budget rows duplicated | `years` parameter too high | Verify `years` matches Notice of Award period |
| pybtex `PybtexError` | Malformed author string | Use "Last, First" format; escape special characters |
| Abstract word count over limit | Run-on sentences | Use `write_structured_abstract()` validator; trim each section |
| BibTeX missing fields | Incomplete entry dict | Check required fields: author, title, journal, year |
| Indirect rate mismatch | Stale F&A agreement | Retrieve current negotiated rate from institutional grants office |

## Examples

### Example 1 — Full NIH Specific Aims Page Rendered via Jinja2

```python
# Run from the project root; requires jinja2 and python-dotenv installed
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Re-use functions defined in Step 1
text = render_specific_aims(EXAMPLE_AIMS_CONTENT)
word_count = len(text.split())
char_count = len(text)

print(f"=== NIH Specific Aims Page ({'~' + str(word_count)} words) ===\n")
print(text)
print(f"\n[Characters: {char_count} | Target: ≤ 3500 for one page at 11pt Arial]")

# Save to file for review
with open("specific_aims_final.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
    fh.write(text)
print("\nSaved to specific_aims_final.txt")
```
