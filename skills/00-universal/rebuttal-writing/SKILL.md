# Rebuttal Writing

> **TL;DR** — Structured academic peer-review response writing. Covers point-by-point
> rebuttal structure, tone calibration for hostile/constructive/minor comments,
> a complete LaTeX rebuttal template, Python parsers for review text, polite phrase
> banks for each scenario, and cover letter structure for re-submission.

## 1. Overview

### What Problem Does This Skill Solve?

Responding to peer review is one of the most strategically demanding parts of academic
publishing. A poorly structured rebuttal — even for strong science — can lead to rejection
at the revision stage. This Skill provides:

- **Point-by-point structure** that editors and reviewers expect
- **Tone calibration** templates covering hostile, constructive, and minor comments
- A **complete LaTeX rebuttal document** ready to compile
- **Python utilities** to parse raw review text and scaffold response sections
- **Phrase banks** for agree, disagree-but-address, clarification-only, and
  experiment-added scenarios
- A **response-length calibration guide** and **re-submission cover letter** template

### Applicable Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Entry Point |
|---|---|
| Major revision from a top journal | Full LaTeX template + `parse_review_text()` |
| Hostile reviewer comment | `tone_phrases["disagree"]` + length guide |
| Minor revision / clarification only | `tone_phrases["clarification"]` scaffold |
| New experiment requested by reviewer | `tone_phrases["experiment_added"]` |
| Preparing cover letter for re-submission | Cover letter template in Section 6 |
| Deciding whether to appeal a rejection | Decision checklist in Section 5 |

### Key Principles

1. **Address every comment** — even those you disagree with. Silence signals evasion.
2. **Be respectful but direct** — excessive hedging weakens your scientific position.
3. **Quote the reviewer** before responding — removes ambiguity and helps editors follow.
4. **Show the change** — paste the revised text (LaTeX diff or plain) directly in the response.
5. **Number responses hierarchically** — `R1.C3` means Reviewer 1, Comment 3.

## 2. Environment Setup

No special packages are required beyond the Python standard library. The LaTeX template
requires a standard TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).

```bash
# Install a TeX distribution if needed (Linux/macOS example)
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

# Install optional helper for diff highlighting
pip install latexdiff  # provides Python wrapper; or use system latexdiff

# Verify Python utilities
python - <<'EOF'
import re, pathlib, textwrap
print("Standard library OK — no additional packages needed")
EOF
```

for their constructive comments. We have revised the manuscript thoroughly in response
to all points raised. Below we address each comment in turn.
Reviewer comments are reproduced verbatim in shaded boxes.
Our responses appear immediately below each comment.

\section*{Response to Reviewer 1}

% --- Comment 1 ---
\reviewercomment{Reviewer 1, Comment 1}{%
  The manuscript lacks a direct comparison with [BASELINE METHOD]. Without this
  comparison, the claimed improvements cannot be assessed.
}

\response{%
  We thank the reviewer for this important point. We agree that a direct comparison
  with [BASELINE METHOD] strengthens the evaluation. We have added this comparison
  in Table~2 of the revised manuscript. [BASELINE METHOD] achieves
  \textbf{XX.X\%} on [METRIC], while our method achieves \textbf{YY.Y\%},
  a statistically significant improvement ($p < 0.05$, paired $t$-test).
}

\changemade{%
  Table~2 now includes [BASELINE METHOD] as a new row. Section~4.2 (paragraph~3)
  was expanded to discuss these results. The experimental setup for [BASELINE METHOD]
  is described in Appendix~A.
}

% --- Comment 2 ---
\reviewercomment{Reviewer 1, Comment 2}{%
  The motivation in the introduction is weak. It is unclear why this problem matters
  for practitioners.
}

\response{%
  We appreciate this feedback. We have substantially revised the introduction (Section~1,
  paragraphs 1--3) to articulate the practical significance more clearly. Specifically,
  we now open with a concrete motivating example drawn from [DOMAIN] and explicitly
  connect our contribution to two pressing real-world challenges: [CHALLENGE~1] and
  [CHALLENGE~2].
}

\changemade{%
  Introduction revised: paragraphs 1--3 rewritten. A motivating example (Figure~1)
  was added. Word count of introduction increased by approximately 180 words.
}

% ==============================================================
\section*{Response to Reviewer 2}

% --- Comment 1 ---
\reviewercomment{Reviewer 2, Comment 1}{%
  I find the statistical analysis in Section~3 unconvincing. A simple $t$-test is
  insufficient for comparing multiple methods; corrections for multiple comparisons
  are required.
}

\response{%
  The reviewer raises a valid methodological concern. We have replaced the uncorrected
  $t$-tests with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD post-hoc test, which
  appropriately controls the family-wise error rate across the [N] pairwise comparisons
  in Table~3. The revised analysis does not change our main conclusions, but does
  slightly narrow several confidence intervals.
}

\changemade{%
  Section~3.4 revised. Table~3 now reports Tukey-adjusted $p$-values and 95\%~CI.
  The Methods section (Section~2.5) was updated to describe the revised statistical
  procedure.
}

% --- Comment 2 ---
\reviewercomment{Reviewer 2, Comment 2}{%
  Minor: Several references are formatted inconsistently (mix of et~al. and full
  author lists). Please standardise to journal style.
}

\response{%
  We apologise for the inconsistency. All references have been reformatted to conform
  strictly to \textit{\msjournal} author guidelines (APA 7th edition). We used
  Zotero with the \textit{\msjournal} CSL style to ensure consistency.
}

\changemade{%
  All references in the reference list standardised. No substantive content changed.

\section*{Response to Associate Editor}

  Please ensure that the data availability statement is updated to reflect the
  repository hosting your code and data.

## 4. Python Utilities for Review Parsing

### 4.1 Parse Review Text into Structured Comments

```python

from typing import List, Dict, Optional

    """
    Parse raw review text into a structured dict of reviewer -> list of comments.

    The parser is heuristic: it splits on reviewer headers and then on numbered
    comment markers. Works for most journal review formats.

    Args:
        raw_text:        Full text pasted from the review system.
        reviewer_pattern: Regex that identifies a new reviewer section header.
        comment_pattern:  Regex that identifies a new comment within a section.

    Example:
        >>> text = "Reviewer 1\\n1. The introduction is unclear.\\n2. Table 2 needs..."

A point-by-point response to all reviewer and editor comments is included as a
separate document ("rebuttal_letter.pdf"). All changes in the revised manuscript
are highlighted for the reviewers' convenience in the tracked-changes PDF
("manuscript_tracked.pdf").

We believe that the revised manuscript is substantially stronger as a result of the
review process and that it now fully meets the standards of {journal}. We remain
available to provide any additional information or to conduct further revisions
as needed.

Thank you for your continued consideration of our work.

Sincerely,

## 7. Response Length Calibration Guide

| Comment Type | Typical Response Length | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Minor typo / formatting | 1–2 sentences | Nothing to argue; just confirm the fix |
| Clarification request | 2–4 sentences | State the clarification + point to revised text |
| Methodological concern (addressed) | 1–2 paragraphs | Explain the fix + quote revised methods |
| Methodological concern (disagreed) | 2–3 paragraphs | Evidence + explanation + concession if any |
| New experiment requested (done) | 2–3 paragraphs + table/figure reference | Present new result + brief interpretation |
| New experiment requested (declined) | 2–3 paragraphs | Justify scope decision diplomatically |
| Fundamental conceptual disagreement | 3–5 paragraphs | Full argument with citations |

**Golden rule**: Match response length to comment severity. Over-responding to minor
comments dilutes the impact of your substantive responses; under-responding to major
concerns signals dismissiveness.

## 8. End-to-End Example

# --- Example: parse a real review and scaffold a rebuttal ---

Reviewer 1

Comment 1
The abstract does not mention the dataset used in the experiments.

Comment 2
The comparison with baseline X is missing from Table 3. This makes it impossible
to assess whether the proposed method is truly competitive.

Comment 3
Minor: "Equation 4" should be "Equation (4)" throughout.

Reviewer 2

Comment 1
The motivation for the choice of hyperparameter lambda is unclear. How was this
value selected and how sensitive are the results to this choice?

## 9. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Skipping a comment without addressing it | Editor returns immediately for non-compliance | Use `count_comments()` to track coverage |
| Agreeing with every comment unconditionally | Suggests the paper was under-developed | Use `disagree` phrases when scientifically justified |
| Responses longer than the actual paper section | Editor loses track of the actual change | Follow length calibration guide in Section 7 |
| Not showing the revised text | Reviewer must search the manuscript | Always include "The revised text reads: ..." |
| Passive-aggressive phrasing | Inflames reviewer and editor | Run tone check: avoid "obviously", "clearly", "as stated" |
| Cover letter that restates every change | Redundant; editor has the rebuttal letter | Keep cover letter to key changes only (4–6 bullets) |
